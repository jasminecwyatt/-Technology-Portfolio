  <h2> Technology Analysis of PhotoShop </h2>
  <br>
  <h3> Affordances:</h3><p>Photoshop affords the user the ability to manipulate graphics and create new graphics. There are tools that allow enhancement of photographs. There are also options to distort, blur, expand/contract/, crop, and change the color of images. The options in Photoshop mimic real life art tools and photography. This affords the user the ability to digitally render visuals. This program is for users that are more expert. Though a novice may be able to successfully use the tools, Photoshop takesa level of learned skill to use it at its maximum potential. Keyboard shortcuts streamline the design process. Layers allow for multiple images to coexist together but be edited separately which affords the ability to make changes without regret. The ability to make layers invincible also affords creative control. Photoshop also allows the user to lock layers so that the user will not move something that is place. This gives a special advantage when doing tasks like resizing and cropping images. </p><br>
  <h3>Constraints </h3><p>Photoshop has many constraints, the main being the ability to manipulate images into a higher resolution without being pixelated. Since Photoshop renders images and not actual shapes it makes it difficult to expand images beyond its original size without losing image quality. Photoshop files also mustbe saved as large files tomaintain quality which is a constraint to the user by using up computer space. Photoshop is problematic for new users as the options are plentiful. A novice could easily become 
overwhelmed on where to start and how to navigate the software. The use of layers, masks, and actions are difficult to use and can push a novice from wanting to figure it out. A lot of technical jargon is used in Photoshop’s menu which would make it time consuming to figure out what each thing means. Furthermore, each tool has different ways in which a user can use it making it difficult to understand the advantages right away. A huge constraint of Photoshop is the difficultly in learning the program enough to make quality images. Many hours mustbe put into using Photoshop before a user can get into the flow of Photoshop which drawsmany novice users to more user-friendly software. There is a huge learning curve associated with Photoshop.</p><br>
  <h3>Design Process</h3><p>My process using Photoshop is a combination of the classic writing process in conjunction with the freeform process. I mustthink outside of the box so that animage will come out to be quality. I start with a general idea of what I want and start to manipulate objects, wording, and colors to fit my basic idea. Sometimes, I sketch out what I want first, by hand, and then start to work in Photoshop. Once I have ageneral rendering of an imagethen I began to think about placement and use spatial recognition. It is important to design with what would be more appealing to the eye. I use rulers in Photoshop to ensure elements in the image are symmetrical. I also testout the sizing of shapes and typography to make sure that the message I am trying to give is being portrayed properly. A lot of using Photoshop is about developing an image that speaks to the audience. A constraint of this process is that Photoshop is digital art which makes drawing hard. There are two ways I have found to overcome this 
constraint. The first is by scanning in a hand drawn images and then making it digitally appealing. The constraint in this process is that it is very time consuming to change a hand drawn file into a digital one. The other, more sensible way to overcome this constraint, is to use a digital tablet, like Wacom, that uses a stylus to render images into the program. </p><br>
  <h3>Tutorials </h3><p>The tutorials I have chosen will help me to create aquality infographic for my multimodal project. Since infographics can also be printed in was important for me to ensure that my settings in Photoshop will be correct to print in high quality. I also will have to make sure that my onscreen color will matchclosely to the CMYK settings for print quality as this can differ greatly. Since Photoshop has a huge constraint with resizing images without losing quality, I had to find a tutorial that would overcome this barrier. I found two different tutorials that I felt were equally beneficial. I am going to manipulate the resolution for the digital version of my project to ensure the images will not be pixelated. I will also be turning my images into smart objects so that it will keep the quality when manipulating it. Since I have a hard time creating shadows on images the tutorial on shadows was beneficial to me. I plan on creating multiple layers with shadows and comparing real life images so that I can get a realistic effect on my images. I will also be using theshort keys space, shift, and the mouse to create equal shapes for my shadows. I will also need to do a text dispersion. I plan on making the main heading on my infographic transition from rain into the word. When I create the stamp of the rain I will try to get the image to look rain is falling. I will also try and blend 
my letters and use a clear to color gradient on the letters to make the rain look like it is filling to create the letters. The links to the tutorials are as follows: </p>

  <h2> Multimodal Project </h2><br>
  <h3>Recap of the Design Process</h3>
<p>My draft started out as an outline to how I wanted my final multimodal project to be. I wanted to have elements that complemented VAHH’s brand and wanted to add color so that it could appeal visually to the audience. My design process in terms of the graphic elements was to outline a general idea of wanted and then develop from that. For instance, in the screenshot below (1), I used a basic icon of a house in the beginning of my design. I then started to think more about the wording and tried to match my design with what the words wanted to portray. I have an extra storage unit on top of a hill to suggest that it is above flood levels. I also highlight the items that should go into the unit. 
I repeated this same process throughout my design. I start off with a basic image and then develop on it. In the screenshot below (2) I wanted to show a barrier. I knew bricks wouldn’t suffice in my final project because the text refers to barriers like sandbags. I manipulated icons of flour sacks to make them seem like sandbags. In the final design I add the word “sand” to each bag as a real sandbag would have. I also went through and implemented Dr. Covi’s typography choice which was Open Sans. I originally just used the default typeface so that I could outline where I wanted to place things. In my initial draft I had all the text center aligned and per suggestion I made text left aligned. I think it makes it easy to read and won’t strain the eyes like the original alignment did. <br>
  <br>One of the major changes I made was to the divided sections. The draft design has waves that were supposed to look like water. As my design progress I realized that it looked more like hills then water. After looking at images of water in design I found that water has peaks that point. I then decided to go with a design that matched that. It was important for Dr. Covi to have elements in the design that where like that of other Sea Grant Homeowner’s Handbooks. She wanted to implement the hammer and nails into the design. After seeing the other handbooks, I realized that they also had a light wood element. I wanted to incorporate that into the design of this infographic as it will make the brand more cohesive as I develop other digital elements. </p><br>

  <h3>Final Product vs Proposal </h3><p>
My final product ended up being more than I intended it on originally turning out. It has the color elements, typography, and image elements that I wanted to implement into the design. During the proposal phase I wanted the infographic to be straight to the point. As my design progress I began to realize that I wanted to include a section with more information. I added that section to the end of the infographic and I think the points draw together the whole project. </p><br>

  <h3>Rhetorical Considerations and Design Choices</h3><p>
In my design I used spatial awareness to ensure that images and typography were aligned properly. I wanted to create a balance that was appealing to the eye. I also want the design to have a personable but professional feel to it. My choice to implement a third color in the main design made for a more appealing design. If I would have kept it on two colors, then it would have turned out to be bland and not appealing to the reader. I also chose to use a normal font size, 12pt, because the larger font made the design too busy. As my design developed I started to feel like the large text was jumping out at me too much causing my concentration to stray. Overall, I kept aesthetics, font, colors, and placement in mind when designing my final project.         </p>
